Problem 1: DNA nucleotide counter

Deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) is a polymer comprised of four different nucleic acids, or nucleotides. 
These 4 nucleotides are adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C).

'''

def nucleotide_counter(s):
    '''
    Returns the number of occurences for each nucleotide given a DNA sequence.

    nucleotide_counter: Str -> dictof(Str, Nat)

    where Str âˆˆ ['A', 'G', 'C', 'T'] and len(s) <= 1000

    '''
    count = {}
    for n in s:
        if n in count:
            count[n] += 1
        elif n not in ["A", "G", "T", "C"]:
            return "Error: Unknown nucleotide in sequence."
        else:
            count[n] = 1
    return count

'''
Problem 2: Transcribing DNA into RNA

Ribose nucleic acid (RNA) is the second nucleic acid, where DNA is the first. 
DNA serves as a blueprint for RNA sequences, where RNA sequences are identical to 
a given DNA sequence with every thymine (T) nucleotide is replaced with a uracil (U) nucleotide.
