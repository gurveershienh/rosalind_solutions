Problem 1: DNA nucleotide counter

Deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) is a polymer comprised of four different nucleic acids, or nucleotides. 
These 4 nucleotides are adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C).

Problem 2: Transcribing DNA into RNA

Ribose nucleic acid (RNA) is the second nucleic acid, where DNA is the first. 
DNA serves as a blueprint for RNA sequences, where RNA sequences are identical to 
a given DNA sequence with every thymine (T) nucleotide is replaced with a uracil (U) nucleotide.
